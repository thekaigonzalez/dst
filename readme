dynamic string allocator

    it's the same idea as my string.h, with nearly NINETY PERCENT of the code
    trimmed because of the simplicity of it.

    it takes the old concept and removes the hard limit in place for
    continuously allocating the string's memory

    and also adds a new function (puts), which allows you to put a string into
    the data type without the need for multiple append_string calls
